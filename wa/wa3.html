        <h2> General </h2>
        <p>Megan Jovon Ruth Pete (born February 15, 1995), known professionally as Megan Thee Stallion, is an American rapper, singer, and songwriter. Originally from Houston, Texas, she first garnered attention when videos of her freestyling became popular on social media platforms such as Instagram. She signed with 1501 Certified Entertainment in 2018, and saw her mainstream breakthrough the following year with the release of her singles "Hot Girl Summer" (featuring Ty Dolla Sign and Nicki Minaj) and "Cash Shit" (featuring DaBaby); the former peaked at number 11 on the Billboard Hot 100 while the latter received quadruple platinum certification by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). "Cash Shit" was also included on her commercial mixtape Fever (2019), which was followed by her extended play Suga (2020)—both of which peaked within the top ten of the Billboard 200.
            <br><br><br>
            Megan Thee Stallion earned two number-one songs on the Billboard Hot 100 in 2020 with her single "Savage Remix" (featuring Beyoncé) and her guest appearance on Cardi B's single "WAP". The former won two Grammy Awards—Best Rap Performance and Best Rap Song—while the latter became her first number-one song in several international markets, including becoming the inaugural number-one on the Billboard Global 200. Her debut studio album, Good News (2020), was met with critical and commercial success—reaching number two on the Billboard 200. It spawned the single "Body", which made her the first female act to release three number-one songs on the Streaming Songs chart within a year. Her compilation album Something for Thee Hotties (2021) peaked at number five on the Billboard 200 and spawned the Billboard Hot 100-top 20 single "Thot Shit", which received a Grammy Award nomination. Her 2022 single "Sweetest Pie" (with Dua Lipa) was met with similar success and preceded the release of her second studio album Traumazine (2022), which peaked at number four on the Billboard 200. In 2024, her single "Hiss" from her third studio album Megan (2024) became her first solo song to top the Billboard Hot 100 and made her the first solo female rapper to debut atop the Billboard Global 200 chart.
            <br><br><br>      
            In July 2020, Megan Thee Stallion was shot in the foot by Canadian rapper Tory Lanez in the Hollywood Hills neighborhood of Los Angeles. The shooting was a major thematic element of her debut album Good News. In December 2022, Lanez was convicted on all counts in relation to the attack on her. After the shooting trial and following a prolonged legal dispute with her record label, Megan Thee Stallion parted ways with 1501 and 300 Entertainment in 2023 in favor of a career as an independent artist.
            <br><br><br>            
            Megan has received various accolades in her career, including six BET Awards, five BET Hip Hop Awards, four American Music Awards, two MTV Video Music Awards, a Billboard Women in Music Award, and three Grammy Awards. At the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, she became the second female rapper to win Best New Artist (after Lauryn Hill in 1999).

        <h2> Early Life </h2>
        <p> Megan Jovon Ruth Pete[1] was born on February 15, 1995[2] in San Antonio, Texas; her mother, Holly Thomas,[3] immediately moved to Houston after her birth.[4] Thomas rapped under the name "Holly-Wood" and brought her daughter with her to recording sessions instead of putting her in daycare.[3] Pete grew up in the South Park neighborhood of Houston[5] and moved with her mother to Pearland at age 14, where she lived until she was 18.[3] Pete began writing raps at age 14.[6] When she eventually showed Thomas her rapping skills at age 18, Thomas required that Pete wait until she was 21 to pursue rapping as a career.[7] Her mother commented that her lyrics were too sexually suggestive for her young age.[8] Pete attended Pearland High School[1] and graduated in 2013.[9] Her father died during her freshman year of high school.[1]
            <br> <br>
            In 2013, while Pete was a freshman at Prairie View A&M University, she began uploading videos of herself freestyling on social media.[5] A clip of her battling against male opponents in a "cypher" went viral. The exposure helped her gain a larger digital presence and following on social media.[5][6][7][10] She garnered fans by posting her freestyles on her Instagram while working at a Bombshells to support herself as a college student. Pete refers to her fans as "hotties" and credits her 'hyperactive' fan base for her early success.[11][12] After taking time off from school to pursue music, she returned home resuming her studies at Texas Southern University. She graduated on December 11, 2021 with a Bachelor of Science in health administration.[7][13]
            <br> <br>
            Pete adopted the stage name "Megan Thee Stallion" after she was called a "stallion" during her adolescence due to her height (5 ft 10 in (178 cm))[7] and "thicc" body frame;[10] voluptuous, statuesque women in the southern United States are sometimes colloquially called "stallions".[1]</p>

        <h2> Artistry </h2>  
        <h3> Public Image</h3>
        <p> Megan Thee Stallion was noted for presenting her sexuality throughout her lyrics, videos, and live performances.[8] In an interview with Pitchfork she stated, "It's not just about being sexy, it's about being confident and me being confident in my sexuality."[133] On her Texas rap origins, she told Rolling Stone, "I don't feel like we ever really had a female rapper come from Houston or Texas and shut shit down. So that's where I'm coming from."[8] She is often regarded as a sex symbol.[134][135][136]</p>
        <h3> Influences</h3>

Other inspirations she has mentioned are the Notorious B.I.G., Lil' Kim, Queen Latifah, Eve, Three 6 Mafia, Trina, Salt-N-Pepa, Missy Elliott,[137] Foxy Brown[138] and she credits Q-Tip as her mentor.[139][10][6][12] She has stated in interviews that when she was younger, she would listen to her favorite rap songs from acts like Three 6 Mafia and Pimp C, and ask herself, "How good would this sound if a girl did it?"[133]
            <br> <br>
            She has also been influenced by Beyoncé. In her Grammy Awards acceptance speech with Beyoncé for "Savage", she said: "Ever since I was little, I was like, 'you know what?

    <h3> Shooting</h3>
   <p> On July 15, 2020, Megan Thee Stallion stated that she had suffered gunshot wounds, and that she had undergone surgery to remove the bullets. Her statement countered an earlier TMZ report that she had injured her foot on broken glass three days prior when she was in a car with rap and R&B musician Tory Lanez (Daystar Peterson) and an unidentified woman. The car was pulled over by police, and Lanez was arrested on gun charges following a vehicle search.[200][201][202]
    <br> <br>
    On July 27, 2020, Megan revealed that she had been shot in both feet, and denounced rumors in an Instagram Live session where she tearfully recounted the shooting incident.[202][203] The following month, Megan claimed that Lanez was the person who shot her, saying, "I didn't tell the police what happened immediately right there because I didn't want to die."[204][205][206] In a statement to Variety, Megan's attorney, Alex Spiro, claimed Lanez's representatives had attempted to launch a "smear campaign", using falsified messages to "peddle a false narrative" discrediting Megan.[207] Lanez's team denied this, stating that they would investigate whoever was behind the fake emails, then would take appropriate action.[208] Megan later confirmed that she had been offered money by Lanez and his team to keep quiet on the incident.[209]
    <br> <br>
    On October 8, 2020, Lanez was charged with shooting Megan Thee Stallion by Los Angeles County prosecutors. His arraignment was scheduled on October 13;[210][211] however, it was rescheduled for November 18 after Lanez's attorney requested a continuance. Megan was issued a protection order against Lanez, directing him to stay at least 100 yards (91 m) away from her, and to not contact her. He was also ordered to surrender any guns he owns.[212] In an op-ed for The New York Times, published on October 13, 2020, Megan addressed the shooting allegation further, writing, "Black women are still constantly disrespected and disregarded in so many areas of life. I was recently the victim of an act of violence by a man. After a party, I was shot twice as I walked away from him. We were not in a relationship. Truthfully, I was shocked that I ended up in that place."[213][212]
    <br> <br>
    In April 2022, Lanez was arrested for violating the protection order relating to the case; and he was released shortly after on an increased bond of $350,000.[214][215] On December 13, 2022, Megan Thee Stallion testified in Lanez's assault trial and stated that she "wish[ed Tory] would have just shot and killed me."[216][217] On December 23, 2022, a jury convicted Lanez on three felony charges stemming from the shooting: assault with a semiautomatic handgun, having a loaded and unregistered firearm in a vehicle, and gross negligence in discharging his firearm.[218] On August 8, 2023, Tory Lanez was sentenced to 10 years in prison for the shooting.[219]</p>
